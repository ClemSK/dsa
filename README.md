# Data structures and algorithms

Go implementation of data structures and algorithms for learning purposes.

To run go to the specific file, implement and write/run the corresponding tests.

## How to use this project

This is a collection of quick scripts and not a traditional API / CLI.

As such, the project is divided into **Data structures** and **Algorithms**.

To run sections, navigate to the required section and run `go run ./fileName` to check the output in the terminal.

Once satisfied, run the tests to make sure you meet the criteria for passing with `go test fileName_test.go`
